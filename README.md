# Project: Semantic Segmentation for Road of Cars using U-Net and applying Data Augmentations techniques
This project aims to perform semantic segmentation on road images using the U-Net architecture implemented with PyTorch. The trained model is then converted to the ONNX format for improved inference speed using the ONNX Runtime.
the target of this simple project is how to build this cycle from data to deploy although we can improve accuracy but get more data and make it learn more epochs and try anthor powerful model
